## Frogger 3D Basic


A very basic (hence the name) clone of the classic arcade game [Frogger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger).
This was a small project I did back in college in 2003.
The goal was to create a simple but fully functional game (i.e. it has graphics, keyboard input, gameplay and some "menu screens" but no audio).
It helped me convince [Larian Studios](http://www.larian.com/) to accept me as an intern.

It's written in C++ (Visual Studio 6 projetc files included) and uses DirectX 9.
